Also, you have no control over the AC or the fan that is in the room (mounted on the ceiling so you can't reach it).  To adjust either of these you have to go to the reception.  Often no one is there and one of the two people who was there speaks no English, or Chinese, or even Hindi.  The other guy speaks English but it kinda rude, as if you're being a jerk asking him to do his job.",It was the cheapest place I could find.,
