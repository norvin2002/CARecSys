The bunk bed i was using, theres this loud squeaking sound whenever i move because the spring is broken or something.
2. I dont think they clean the room on a regular basis becuase i saw a dead cockroach on the floor.
3. The bed sheet, pillow case and blanket doesnt look clean, probably it is but since its so old or been washed gazillion of times, the color faded.
4. There are 2 toilet and bath shared by 6 people in the room that needs improvement. Theres no bidet and its so small, you can barely move while youre in there.
5. Breakfast is also disappointing, they only offer bread, coffee and tea. They have 4 kinds of sandwich spread which i didnt try, i just had my bread toasted and coffee that day.
6. The room looks so different from the picture shown in the website, its misleading.","1. There were many small food shops/restaurants near our hostel that offers indian and chinese cuisines.
2. Near 2 subway stations. (I forgot the names, if I remember it correctly, Rochor and Jelan Basar stations)
3. Theres a local convenience store, few steps away from the hostel also 7-eleven, about 100m away. 
4. The filipina receptionist is very nice, warm, welcoming and smiling when we came in.

Pay more and find someplace else.”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Solo traveller', '• Bed in 14-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room', '• Stayed 4 nights']","Everything else is quite disappointing and quite disgusting - nothing like the pictures shown. I stayed there for 4 nights and it was a mistake. 
I stayed in the Attic storey, which was on the 3rd floor. The room is divided into two, so each half shares a bathroom. My half consisted of 6 beds, two fans, and a half-decent air conditioner.
Here are a few major things to complain about: 
SPACE - Not much place for you to put your things in such a small space; just a small shelf and a couple hooks if they aren't broken. I ended up hanging my wet towel and sweaty clothes on my bed frame and posts. I highly recommend renting a locker to be safe from pests and theft.
PESTS - On the last night, I found that there is a pretty serious rat infestation. My backpack was gnawed through by rats. I found out that they were actually attacking my bag and made a gaping hole, I threw the snacks into the waste bin, which they then later started attacking. At least five or more fought over the food all night long. I brought it up to the front desk (who I'm guessing is the owner/manager) when I checked out in the morning that there was a pest problem. He just smiled at me and said nothing because there were other people who came in to check in. I uploaded a photo of my eaten bag. 
CLEANLINESS - Given that there is a major rat problem here, you should be careful everywhere. Don't walk barefeet. Fortunately, the sheets, pillows, and blanket looked and smelled clean. The bathroom was ""cleaned"" every two days. There were used bottles on the floor the whole time I stayed there. Not much space to put your belongings to avoid getting soaked. There is a huge musty smell throughout the place from the lack of ventilation. 
SIMCARD - The hostel says they would provide a simcard to use during your stay. They didn't receive any new simcards and the existing ones were expired.","Location is pretty central, so it's convenient for travel.
