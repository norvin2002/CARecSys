First of all, they say that there is WiFi. This is not true. Stayed here for several days and WiFi worked maybe one time out of ten. And when it worked it was extremely slow. Why promise WiFi when it’s not true? Second, the people working here leave the hostel at 11 pm, so not 24 h reception. One time I told them before they went home for the day that there was no toiletpaper in any of the two toilets that more than 50 (yes 50) people share together (disgusting toilets too), and THEY DID NOT refill the toilet paper until the next day, almost 12 hours later. Imagine how the toilets smelled and what they looked like.. Thirdly, it smelled as if there was a dead animal in the dorm that we were sleeping in, AND the rooms are extremely small so you basically sleep just right next to the person in the other bed (you can just reach out and touch a random person - or a random person can touch you). Fourth, the laundry is crazy expensive. Fifth, when I arrive they didn’t even show me were the washroom was, nor did I get a lower bed (I have a knee injury) even though saying to the staff that it’s extremely painful for me to climb up to the upper bed. Sixth, there are sooo many people staying in a very very small area, they are just trying to fit in as many beds as possible on a very small area and with as little of staff as possible.
