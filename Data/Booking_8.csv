Secondly, the lobby, lift and corridor had a bad smell for some reason. 
Thirdly, the level was like a maze. We had to make turns numerous times to reach our room. 
Forthly, my gf and i were really disappointed when we entered our room because it looked run-down and old.
Room and bed sheets were unclean. Bed sheets had dirty and black spots. Towels had stains. Room was super cramped. Shower head was loose like it was gonna break anytime and they didnt bother to fix it. Dirty bathroom. 
There were 2 of us but they provided us with 1 cup only. kettle was dusty and rusty.... 
We paid SGD494 for 2 nights and it didnt worth our money. We understand that we booked the hotel during peak period so it was more expensive but the main point is, we paid so much but it was such a waste of our money...... it was an uncomfortable experience. 
Customer service was alright. 
Overall, arianna hotel is the worst hotel we’ve ever stayed. Even Hotel 81, a budget hotel is so much better.  Unfortunately, we forgot to take pics of the room.

I coordinated with my card issuer, until now there is no funds being credited to my account. 
I know, probably this was not a human error but I suggest that there should be a consideration given since we had a proof that the hotel charged us already for the five-day stay. They should have returned the cash payment instead of the card payment.

We had to pay AGAIN . The hotel promised to make a refund on October 24, 2017 with a bank prove .Yet, we still havent received any , even after the frequent negotiations with the hotel through booking.com 
Second ,  pictures tell our story . Viewers can enjoy the photos attached first . We originally booked a double room at this hotel for 4D3N . As late check-in, we were upgraded and assigned to stay the first night in a triple room  ,basic and a bit old, still which was so nice of their act.
However, we had never thought of any nightmare coming up . The next day we were arranged to this double room.  We even found TWO baby COCKROACHES hanging around on the tea-table. We regretted not to take the bodies of them ...
The secured lock of the room door was broken . The knob of the bathroom couldnt function well .  
We immediately called for changing another room , the room service just told us that they run a budget hotel thats why we ended up like that . They refused to change a new room for us NOR made any compensation just because the manager was off the duty . (The staff said) 
We realized this hotel is a 2 star one or may be a budget one when we had made a reservation. HOWEVER, we have NEVER experienced such trashy stay in Singapore, marked an obvious stink in our trip . 
Besides, we met and talked to 3 staff at the hotel and none of them was patient . Their gesture and tone of speaking were very impatient  and instructive. 
Dont stay in this so-callled 2 star hotel anymore. Every thing is shabbier than a local inn or a motel.
