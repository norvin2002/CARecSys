We booked a family room of 6 and turned out that there is a time-controlled aircon from 7.00pm to 9.30am but apparently there is no such info on booking.com. The staff tried to look through and finally showed us a tiny caption in one of the photos saying about this time limit but seriously who would flip through all the photos and read all the small captions. 
2) I explained to the staff that we had a toddler with us so this is definitely unacceptable. Yet she said there is nothing she can do about it and in order to turn on the AC for 24 hours we need to top up $6 per pax per night, which means $42 for our room per night!
3) I called booking.com for help and after 1 hour the staff said that her management agreed for us to turn on AC for 24 hours with the additional top up of $6 per room per night. Since it is so hard for us to find a family room last min we had no option but to accept this. But I believe by right we should not have had to pay for this additional cost
4) Male toilet room are unclean
5) Facilities have run down so much since my first stay a few years ago. Even room fan also not working properly. Mattresses are so so old with so many stains and you even have to put on the bed linen and pillow cover by yourself - which is surprisingly a difficult task given the linens are especially tiny compared to the mattress size.
Overall it is supposed to be a value for money hostel but after looking at the additional AC top up and the bad conditions of this hotel I have to say you are paying more than what you eventually get.

Besides the awesome value for money, the location was amazing; very accessible to the ROCHER BLUE-LINE MRT!
The Staff were amazing and they know the famous tourist spots very well. They also offered to my Mom and I discounted ticket prices that added more pocket money for us.
Darius/Papu was our main contact person (he is the Front Desk Officer there). There was also a Filipino guy and and a Singaporean Girl who stood as front desk officers; all of them were amazing! 
When we were about to leave for Manila, the front desk suggested an airport shuttle pick-up for us, which only costed $ 9 SD-very affordable and it was time-and-cost efficient!

"Footprints Hostel, Singapore",Reviewed: 23 February 2018,USA,7.9,26,"“Solid, if not exceptional, hostel in a good location”","['• Leisure trip', '• Solo traveller', '• Bed in 10-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room', '• Stayed 5 nights']","The air conditioner is off during the day. Not a problem for me since I was out sightseeing, but something to consider. I think this is common for hostels in Singapore though. 
The breakfast is very basic but I expected as much. The issue is that there is not enough physical space to accommodate everyone at peak times. I can't see any solution to this and it was only a minor inconvenience, but something to be aware of. 
There seems to be two types of people that stay in the hostel: typical backpackers and families or others there for non-tourist reasons. Strangely, it was the latter group that caused issues during my stay as they were incredibly noisy late at night, often screaming down the halls. There are signs to respect quiet hours but these guests ignored them. I don't know if this is a common occurrence of if I just had bad luck during my stay. Perhaps the latter since I was there for lunar new year and my last night was much quieter. 
I wanted to head to the airport at 12:30 so asked if I could check out a half hour late and was told I could not. It wasn't a huge inconvenience for me, but I also don't see why a half hour really mattered to the staff.","The power outlet, small shelf and individual light for each bed was very helpful. 
I had read someone say something about no hot water, but I always had it for my showers and I never had a problem finding an available shower stall during my stay. 
Besides noise from guests in the halls, the hostel was generally quiet and peaceful and the walls seemed to do a good job blocking noise from adjoining rooms. Also, the TV is in the lobby on the ground floor so no worries about having to hear that or anyone who might be socializing down there. 
The location is very convenient in that it is close to two Downtown Line MRT stations and not too far to walk to the Little India station, which is adjacent to the excellent Tekka Hawker center for inexpensive and delicious food options. If you don't mind a bit of walking you can even walk to the popular downtown/bay areas. Also, while the hostel is in Little India, it is in a very clean and fairly quiet part of it.",Stayed in February 2018,7.5,6.9,6.8,8.4,7,8.3,7.6,8.2
