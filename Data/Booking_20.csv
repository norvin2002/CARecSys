Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night.

Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.
— Despite the sloppy room service (see below) the beds were always freshly done and the mattresses felt new and very good.
— If the noise wouldn't be so terrible in that street, this could be (in theory) a nice hotel for relaxing sleep.",Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

So we arrived at this hotel at 8pm after travelling over 24 hours from london heathrow. We get to the hotel at 8pm go to bed for 10pm. The room was tiny and whilst trying to sleep the noise from next door was absolutely awful the windows shook with the base from the music even though we tried to sleep we had no chance boom boom boom i went to reception at 2:00am as at this point it was a joke. The reception man said its beyond his control and he has no where to move us. I asked what time is the music going on til as its not acceptable we have travelled so far and need sleep,he said about 3:30....No it was 4am the music stopped. I finally got to sleep at 5:30am. The next day was the only full day we had in Singapore before our flight to Cambodia, so sleeping all day was not an option and we haven’t traveled all this way to sleep all day in a small dingy room.we got up at 8:30 to go for the “american breakfast “ (guys don’t count on a good one ) it was basic simple
And cheap . So i spoke to Satiman he was apparently the manager,the next morning he said he was sorry and he will move us to room 201 and tried to give that rubbish around its a suite and upgrade complimentary. It was the same as other room with a pointless bath tub in the middle. I told him this will be fine for tonight but i refuse to pay for a night in a room where i did not sleep or get what i paid for. His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

The aircon outside the room on one of the window also made humming noises. It's alright, but just note that the room is not quiet and sound proof.
I dont like that it has a late check in (3pm). We practically wasted 1/2 a day in the hot sun outside.
A bit expensive for one night for this non sound-proof room. Well, a no good night sleep really ruins quite a bit.","Everything else is good.
Customer service, check in check out was smooth.
The room was clean and bed was very comfortable.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.
— Despite the sloppy room service (see below) the beds were always freshly done and the mattresses felt new and very good.
— If the noise wouldn't be so terrible in that street, this could be (in theory) a nice hotel for relaxing sleep.",Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

The reception man said its beyond his control and he has no where to move us. I asked what time is the music going on til as its not acceptable we have travelled so far and need sleep,he said about 3:30....No it was 4am the music stopped. I finally got to sleep at 5:30am. The next day was the only full day we had in Singapore before our flight to Cambodia, so sleeping all day was not an option and we haven’t traveled all this way to sleep all day in a small dingy room.we got up at 8:30 to go for the “american breakfast “ (guys don’t count on a good one ) it was basic simple

His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal.

One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.
— Despite the sloppy room service (see below) the beds were always freshly done and the mattresses felt new and very good.
— If the noise wouldn't be so terrible in that street, this could be (in theory) a nice hotel for relaxing sleep.",Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it. The hotel is small and it would be considerate to at least let people know that there would be disruption.","The decor is beautifully designed.

Breakfast could've been better. Our breakfast meal consists of eggs (scrambled or sunny) and bread (White or Wheat + strawberry jam or butter) White milk and corn flakes, thats pretty much it. Also expected room service to be better. My room wasn't made for two days, when i called to ask why? they finally sent someone to make our rooms in the afternoon. It comes down to the price you pay. For the same amount you could opt for a similar hotel, with more amenities and a better breakfast with better room service. But if you think filling your Instagram with a bunch of Wes Anderson inspired photos is more important, then by all means this is the place for you. Alternatively i would suggest coming for a meal at 'The Great Mischief' ( their in house restaurant) instead of spending your nights here, Just my two cents.","The overall concept of the hotel is admirable. Many would say that the place has a very Wes Anderson feel. It does and the interior and decor is brilliantly done. There are many photographable spots for you to fill your Instagram with.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms. Extremely comfy bed that felt like a marshmallow!

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs. The spread were limited to only fruits, bread and cereals. I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold. 
I hope the management can take this as a constructive criticism and do something about it because the couple that came after us left the hotel and head out for breakfast too. 
It'll be sad to see the beautiful hotel to loose its customer because of this. 
I was aware that the latest time I can check out was 12:30pm, my partner had it checked before he left. Around 12:10pm an employee knocked my door and greeted me with "" what time are you checking out?"". I had a good stay in Madras and did not want the approach to ruin my day. Hence, I answered with ""soon"". It'll be great if I was approached in a different manner to remind me of the check out time. A smile will be great :)",I love the quirky designs of the hotel.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it. The hotel is small and it would be considerate to at least let people know that there would be disruption.","The decor is beautifully designed.

There was no space at all to put or hang clothes, apart from a small drawer below the bed. The balcony was exactly above a relatively loud bar and right beside a hostel where they play loud (and not always good) live music every night. The most annoying was the smell of the kitchen which comes up in the early morning hours when they start preparing the breakfast in the coffee shop downstairs. Considering that you are in an Indian neighbourhood, the choice of breakfast dishes is very poor with only one kind of omlette and fried potatoes plus a bit of cereals and toast. Even if they have a proper coffee machine in the coffee shop, they don't switch it on for breakfast, so you have to be happy with the filter coffee and cold milk. Considering the price per night and the four stars hotel status, this is not what you would expect.","The Great Madras is a well situated hotel. The staff is very sweet and helpful.

Also expected room service to be better. My room wasn't made for two days, when i called to ask why? they finally sent someone to make our rooms in the afternoon. It comes down to the price you pay.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms. Extremely comfy bed that felt like a marshmallow!

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.
— Despite the sloppy room service (see below) the beds were always freshly done and the mattresses felt new and very good.

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs. The spread were limited to only fruits, bread and cereals. I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold. 
I hope the management can take this as a constructive criticism and do something about it because the couple that came after us left the hotel and head out for breakfast too. 
It'll be sad to see the beautiful hotel to loose its customer because of this. 
I was aware that the latest time I can check out was 12:30pm, my partner had it checked before he left. Around 12:10pm an employee knocked my door and greeted me with "" what time are you checking out?"". I had a good stay in Madras and did not want the approach to ruin my day. Hence, I answered with ""soon"". It'll be great if I was approached in a different manner to remind me of the check out time. A smile will be great :)",I love the quirky designs of the hotel.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it. The hotel is small and it would be considerate to at least let people know that there would be disruption.","The decor is beautifully designed.

Considering that you are in an Indian neighbourhood, the choice of breakfast dishes is very poor with only one kind of omlette and fried potatoes plus a bit of cereals and toast. Even if they have a proper coffee machine in the coffee shop, they don't switch it on for breakfast, so you have to be happy with the filter coffee and cold milk.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Also, my partner said that he heard people fighting in the middle of the night so loud that he had to get up and take a look from the room balcony and he saw a big crowd with two guys fighting, literally punching each other, so he could’t get any sleep that night.","The interior is perfect and instagram-worthy even the room is quite small but I love how they can manage to put everything useful in such a small space, everything seems new and clean. The location is the best, we can walk to the mrt station (Rochor) or the bus stop which is less than 5 minutes.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.

His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal. We was so exhausted we managed to sleep around 12am.",The property its self is quite nice i like the theme they went with..,Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs. The spread were limited to only fruits, bread and cereals. I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold. 
I hope the management can take this as a constructive criticism and do something about it because the couple that came after us left the hotel and head out for breakfast too. 
It'll be sad to see the beautiful hotel to loose its customer because of this. 
I was aware that the latest time I can check out was 12:30pm, my partner had it checked before he left.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it.

The room I stayed in was not terribly clean. Many surfaces were still dusty and dirty, glass doors were stained and so were some of the bedsheets.
Service was abysmal. I asked Muthu at the front desk whether there were quieter rooms available and he informed me that I must wait until the night shift receptionist came on duty before asking. I then asked whether he could simply help me check now. He proceeded to shout at me for 'forcing him to do things' and that he felt ""forced"". Even for Singapore, that's bad service.

The Great Madras,Reviewed: 17 February 2018,Denmark,6.7,7,“Beautiful hotel... Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line. So it makes it super convenient to travel.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

My partner and I tried having a breakfast the first morning there but we decided to find somewhere else to eat. Also, my partner said that he heard people fighting in the middle of the night so loud that he had to get up and take a look from the room balcony and he saw a big crowd with two guys fighting, literally punching each other, so he could’t get any sleep that night.","The interior is perfect and instagram-worthy even the room is quite small but I love how they can manage to put everything useful in such a small space, everything seems new and clean. The location is the best, we can walk to the mrt station (Rochor) or the bus stop which is less than 5 minutes.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India

— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station

So we arrived at this hotel at 8pm after travelling over 24 hours from london heathrow. We get to the hotel at 8pm go to bed for 10pm. The room was tiny and whilst trying to sleep the noise from next door was absolutely awful the windows shook with the base from the music even though we tried to sleep we had no chance boom boom boom i went to reception at 2:00am as at this point it was a joke. The reception man said its beyond his control and he has no where to move us. I asked what time is the music going on til as its not acceptable we have travelled so far and need sleep,he said about 3:30....No it was 4am the music stopped. I finally got to sleep at 5:30am. The next day was the only full day we had in Singapore before our flight to Cambodia, so sleeping all day was not an option and we haven’t traveled all this way to sleep all day in a small dingy room.we got up at 8:30 to go for the “american breakfast “ (guys don’t count on a good one ) it was basic simple
And cheap . So i spoke to Satiman he was apparently the manager,the next morning he said he was sorry and he will move us to room 201 and tried to give that rubbish around its a suite and upgrade complimentary. It was the same as other room with a pointless bath tub in the middle. I told him this will be fine for tonight but i refuse to pay for a night in a room where i did not sleep or get what i paid for. His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal. We was so exhausted we managed to sleep around 12am.",The property its self is quite nice i like the theme they went with..,Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs. The spread were limited to only fruits, bread and cereals. I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold. 
I hope the management can take this as a constructive criticism and do something about it because the couple that came after us left the hotel and head out for breakfast too.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it.

The hotel is located next to 3 different bars, in a densely packed and lively area of Little India, with old, thin windows (you know, for the retro look). If you like sleep, stay elsewhere or bring a box of earplugs with you.
The room I stayed in was not terribly clean. Many surfaces were still dusty and dirty, glass doors were stained and so were some of the bedsheets.
Service was abysmal. I asked Muthu at the front desk whether there were quieter rooms available and he informed me that I must wait until the night shift receptionist came on duty before asking. I then asked whether he could simply help me check now. He proceeded to shout at me for 'forcing him to do things' and that he felt ""forced"". Even for Singapore, that's bad service.

The Great Madras,Reviewed: 17 February 2018,Denmark,6.7,,“Beautiful hotel... Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line. So it makes it super convenient to travel.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

My partner and I tried having a breakfast the first morning there but we decided to find somewhere else to eat. Also, my partner said that he heard people fighting in the middle of the night so loud that he had to get up and take a look from the room balcony and he saw a big crowd with two guys fighting, literally punching each other, so he could’t get any sleep that night.","The interior is perfect and instagram-worthy even the room is quite small but I love how they can manage to put everything useful in such a small space, everything seems new and clean. The location is the best, we can walk to the mrt station (Rochor) or the bus stop which is less than 5 minutes.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

It is true that the (pretty ordinary) music coming from next door can be heard until late but you expect noise in cities and it wasn't too intrusive. It would have been nice to have had the bathrooms cleaned and the bins emptied a little more often. The walls in the room could do with a fresh paint. Otherwise, it was the poor behaviour of other guests, not cleaning up after themselves and making noise at all hours that was our biggest problem.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager

— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station

So we arrived at this hotel at 8pm after travelling over 24 hours from london heathrow. We get to the hotel at 8pm go to bed for 10pm. The room was tiny and whilst trying to sleep the noise from next door was absolutely awful the windows shook with the base from the music even though we tried to sleep we had no chance boom boom boom i went to reception at 2:00am as at this point it was a joke. The reception man said its beyond his control and he has no where to move us. I asked what time is the music going on til as its not acceptable we have travelled so far and need sleep,he said about 3:30....No it was 4am the music stopped. I finally got to sleep at 5:30am. The next day was the only full day we had in Singapore before our flight to Cambodia, so sleeping all day was not an option and we haven’t traveled all this way to sleep all day in a small dingy room.we got up at 8:30 to go for the “american breakfast “ (guys don’t count on a good one ) it was basic simple
And cheap . So i spoke to Satiman he was apparently the manager,the next morning he said he was sorry and he will move us to room 201 and tried to give that rubbish around its a suite and upgrade complimentary. It was the same as other room with a pointless bath tub in the middle. I told him this will be fine for tonight but i refuse to pay for a night in a room where i did not sleep or get what i paid for. His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal. We was so exhausted we managed to sleep around 12am.",The property its self is quite nice i like the theme they went with..,Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs. The spread were limited to only fruits, bread and cereals. I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold. 
I hope the management can take this as a constructive criticism and do something about it because the couple that came after us left the hotel and head out for breakfast too.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it.

The room I stayed in was not terribly clean. Many surfaces were still dusty and dirty, glass doors were stained and so were some of the bedsheets.
Service was abysmal. I asked Muthu at the front desk whether there were quieter rooms available and he informed me that I must wait until the night shift receptionist came on duty before asking. I then asked whether he could simply help me check now. He proceeded to shout at me for 'forcing him to do things' and that he felt ""forced"". Even for Singapore, that's bad service.

The Great Madras,Reviewed: 17 February 2018,Denmark,6.7,,“Beautiful hotel... Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line. So it makes it super convenient to travel.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

My partner and I tried having a breakfast the first morning there but we decided to find somewhere else to eat. Also, my partner said that he heard people fighting in the middle of the night so loud that he had to get up and take a look from the room balcony and he saw a big crowd with two guys fighting, literally punching each other, so he could’t get any sleep that night.","The interior is perfect and instagram-worthy even the room is quite small but I love how they can manage to put everything useful in such a small space, everything seems new and clean. The location is the best, we can walk to the mrt station (Rochor) or the bus stop which is less than 5 minutes.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager

— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station

So we arrived at this hotel at 8pm after travelling over 24 hours from london heathrow. We get to the hotel at 8pm go to bed for 10pm. The room was tiny and whilst trying to sleep the noise from next door was absolutely awful the windows shook with the base from the music even though we tried to sleep we had no chance boom boom boom i went to reception at 2:00am as at this point it was a joke. The reception man said its beyond his control and he has no where to move us. I asked what time is the music going on til as its not acceptable we have travelled so far and need sleep,he said about 3:30....No it was 4am the music stopped. I finally got to sleep at 5:30am. The next day was the only full day we had in Singapore before our flight to Cambodia, so sleeping all day was not an option and we haven’t traveled all this way to sleep all day in a small dingy room.we got up at 8:30 to go for the “american breakfast “ (guys don’t count on a good one ) it was basic simple
And cheap . So i spoke to Satiman he was apparently the manager,the next morning he said he was sorry and he will move us to room 201 and tried to give that rubbish around its a suite and upgrade complimentary. It was the same as other room with a pointless bath tub in the middle. I told him this will be fine for tonight but i refuse to pay for a night in a room where i did not sleep or get what i paid for. His response was he needs to speak to his higher managers and he cant until Monday morning. Ok fine please do so. From there we spent a day tired and angry around Singapore (ruined out experience) we had to wait until after 2pm also to move into the other room so another inconvenience for us. When we got back we moved rooms and then went for dinner. Upon our return getting ready for bed you could still hear the music but fainter and the windows did not vibrate but still not ideal. We was so exhausted we managed to sleep around 12am.",The property its self is quite nice i like the theme they went with..,Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

However, I admit that I was a little disappointed with the breakfast. Probably because my partner and I were expecting for sausages and eggs.

I would like to highlight that the butter were placed in-front of the toaster which resulted the butter to be in liquid form when we opened it. It was like oil spread on our bread. The cold milk for the cereals were not re-filled either. The employee highlighted that there was ""hot-food"". We ordered a plate but the rice served was pretty cold.

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it.

The room I stayed in was not terribly clean. Many surfaces were still dusty and dirty, glass doors were stained and so were some of the bedsheets.
Service was abysmal. I asked Muthu at the front desk whether there were quieter rooms available and he informed me that I must wait until the night shift receptionist came on duty before asking. I then asked whether he could simply help me check now. He proceeded to shout at me for 'forcing him to do things' and that he felt ""forced"". Even for Singapore, that's bad service.

No transparency there. It's inconvenient if travelling with family. Don't know if it's the property owner or booking.com who is to be blamed. 
The mattress has no cot. It's simply placed on the floor. I opted for a Deluxe room on booking.com but the receptionist said that i have booked for a Deluxe Hostel- which means i get a separate room with the mattress on the floor and a shared bathroom. 
No cupboards or a specific place to keep your bags and things.
I'd have booked either way but the least you gotta do is to inform us before hand.","The ambiance of the entire hotel was really really impressive. There a lot of hotels in Little India but i don't think any other hotel's ambiance would match this. Also, the location of the hotel in Little India is on a street which is much calmer and feels safer. The staff are very friendly and are ready to help for anything.

The Great Madras,Reviewed: 17 February 2018,Denmark,6.7,,“Beautiful hotel... Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line. So it makes it super convenient to travel.",Stayed in February 2018,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

Also, my partner said that he heard people fighting in the middle of the night so loud that he had to get up and take a look from the room balcony and he saw a big crowd with two guys fighting, literally punching each other, so he could’t get any sleep that night.","The interior is perfect and instagram-worthy even the room is quite small but I love how they can manage to put everything useful in such a small space, everything seems new and clean.
