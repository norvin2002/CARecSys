Room:
Do not expect individual reading lights or plug socket for your bed just two extension cables for the dorm with only half of these plugs actually working. No lockers for your luggage/backpack. Bed sheets are very low quality and only provided after asking for them.
Aircon? Yes but on the lowest fan speed and set at a temperature that doesn't make a difference. Aircon only turned on from 7pm until 11am. I should also add the position on the aircon unit means it could only really have an effect on 4 beds out of 12. I'd also like to add that the 12 bed dorm on the third floor and the female only dorm isn't fully separated, the wall doesn't go completely to the ceiling meaning that the cool air doesn't actually stay in the room.
Breakfast? Yes but low quality bread that has a sticky feel to it, eggs are boiled and placed in a big container for you to take from. Cheapest butter and cheapest jam provided. 
Bathroom? One bathroom for the whole hostel on the second floor. Could have been cleaned better.
Common room is quite small, limited seating areas especially around breakfast time.","Hostel is in a good location, close to shops and MRT station.",Stayed in February 2019,7.8,7.3,7,8.7,7.4,8.4,8,7.8

The double looked quite tired, but better than the dorms. We booked and paid the first night then afterwards booked a seconds nights stay and asked to pay for it the following day once we got back from town as we didn’t have enough cash for both, we were told that was ok.
When we got back from town in the evening we went up to our room and found our bags on the floor in the main hallway by the bathrooms, plus some of our clothes and belongings in an open bin bag. In our bags we had cash, passports and other valuables. After asking staff at reception what was going on, we were told that check out was at 11am and that we only paid for one night so all of our stuff had been chucked out to make way for a new occupant in the room. When we explained that we’d booked another night they rang the person who was on duty who admitted we asked for a second night and would pay the next day, but we were told that because we hadn’t paid, the room wasn’t booked despite that being agreed on.
I asked why I hadn’t been contacted or to move our belongings or even to let us know our things were just lying in the hall. (They would have my number, email and could contact through booking.com) 
She said she didn’t know. 
I asked why our things weren’t even put in a locker or a storage room.
She said she didn’t know.
Not even an apology!
In the end we had to find a room somewhere else last minute and get a subway across town late at night (it was past 11pm at this point after trying to get hold of the member of staff)
