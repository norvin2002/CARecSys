It was asthough they had employed a blind cleaner who was allergic to cleaning (no offense meant to blind cleaners and people allergic to cleaning). There we hairs all over the shower room floor and I mean obvious, not the casual missed one in the corner, no, there would be less hair on the floor in a salon! There was what looked like nasal excrement smeared up the walls and basically grime in all conceivable places. In fact even places you wouldn’t think there could be grime. The bed was like a bench (now for me personally I like a firm matress, however Donald Trump would have more give on immigration than these stone beauties!) The sheets were that of an incontenant hospital department where if you got in too quick you’d slide across and be off the otherside quicker than a waterpark death slide. The so called fun started when Singatel clearly had a bargain basement deal on for those with Indian mobile numbers, the only issue for us was that the offer only existed in our corridor! The chap was obviously having signal issues though because his receiver obvious couldn’t hear him unless he shouted (either that or he had never been taught about an indoor voice or even the courtesy of having the conversion in your own room). Not that, that would have helped as even the room opposites’ TV echoed beautifully through the corridor and into our room.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• Special Offer - Standard Double Room', '• Stayed 5 nights', '• Submitted via mobile']","Due to the nature of the building many rooms have no windows - do not
get one of these rooms! The lack of sunlight meant we would get woken up
by another guest at around 10am or something and after having had a full
10-12hrs sleep we'd feel groggy and exhausted. It was horrible.
Absolutely horrible. We stayed for 5 nights and I would recommend nobody
stay for more than 1-2 nights because the lack of natural light just
made us feel awful and pretty much ruined the last part of our holiday.
There was a strange lack of furniture, so no bedside tables to put things on, only 1 power point near the tv, and the desk the kettle was on was tiny. No fridge to keep milk in so kind of pointless having a kettle. Nearby is no supermarket so it's quite a hike towards the cbd to find a loaf of bread etc. 
You can get cheaper hotel rooms (reasonably cheaper than one here without any windows and much cheaper than one here with windows) a bit further out of the city (but near a train station) such as in Geylang that have a fridge and windows and supermarkets nearby etc. I highly recommend staying somewhere else such as Bright Star.","There was a hawker stall right on the corner called Economical Curry
Rice (or something similar) run by a lovely woman where you can get a
rice plus 3 choices (meat, veg, tofu, curry) meal for ~$4 which was
tasty and didn't upset our stomachs (we ate there several times),
plus there were heaps of Indian, Indonesian and general halal places in
the area if you're a lover of spicy curry. There's fruit and veg
market stalls a short walk away which were alright.
