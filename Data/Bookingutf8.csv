Room:
Do not expect individual reading lights or plug socket for your bed just two extension cables for the dorm with only half of these plugs actually working. No lockers for your luggage/backpack. Bed sheets are very low quality and only provided after asking for them.
Aircon? Yes but on the lowest fan speed and set at a temperature that doesn't make a difference. Aircon only turned on from 7pm until 11am. I should also add the position on the aircon unit means it could only really have an effect on 4 beds out of 12. I'd also like to add that the 12 bed dorm on the third floor and the female only dorm isn't fully separated, the wall doesn't go completely to the ceiling meaning that the cool air doesn't actually stay in the room.
Breakfast? Yes but low quality bread that has a sticky feel to it, eggs are boiled and placed in a big container for you to take from. Cheapest butter and cheapest jam provided. 
Bathroom? One bathroom for the whole hostel on the second floor. Could have been cleaned better.

The double looked quite tired, but better than the dorms. We booked and paid the first night then afterwards booked a seconds nights stay and asked to pay for it the following day once we got back from town as we didn’t have enough cash for both, we were told that was ok.
When we got back from town in the evening we went up to our room and found our bags on the floor in the main hallway by the bathrooms, plus some of our clothes and belongings in an open bin bag. In our bags we had cash, passports and other valuables. After asking staff at reception what was going on, we were told that check out was at 11am and that we only paid for one night so all of our stuff had been chucked out to make way for a new occupant in the room. When we explained that we’d booked another night they rang the person who was on duty who admitted we asked for a second night and would pay the next day, but we were told that because we hadn’t paid, the room wasn’t booked despite that being agreed on.
I asked why I hadn’t been contacted or to move our belongings or even to let us know our things were just lying in the hall. (They would have my number, email and could contact through booking.com) 
She said she didn’t know. 
I asked why our things weren’t even put in a locker or a storage room.
She said she didn’t know.
Not even an apology!
In the end we had to find a room somewhere else last minute and get a subway across town late at night (it was past 11pm at this point after trying to get hold of the member of staff)

we arrived around 8am and the check in is at 1:30 pm thats when they brought as up to our room. not 12:30 as per their profile at booking.com
as we enter our room we were placed next to the entrance door where people come and go so expect an sleepless night, I tried to ask the western looking staff(who isnt approachable as the other staff)  to move us to the next bed at least, but he wont let us even if we arrived first and nobody is there yet! 
on our first night i was soo itchy I turn my phone flashlight on and VIOLA!! i Saw a freaking BED BUGS not one but 5 bed bugs on my bed. i killed few put them on a tissue and the rest of the BED BUGS were hiding.
The whole night i couldnot sleep I wrap my self with jackets and pants .
In the morning I showed them the BED BUGS on the tissue and then they transfer us to a private room. but the whole night i was itchy as well. 
their pillow case and bed sheet are color red, and you know how bed bugs loves red.
for sure you will meet a lot of travellers in this hostel but so as the other hostel that is cleaner and tidier than this.
The shoes on the stairs is not a good idea because it made the whole hostel stinks and dirty. maybe they should make a shoe rack outside. 
overall cleanliness of the hostel is bad .

We booked a family room of 6 and turned out that there is a time-controlled aircon from 7.00pm to 9.30am but apparently there is no such info on booking.com. The staff tried to look through and finally showed us a tiny caption in one of the photos saying about this time limit but seriously who would flip through all the photos and read all the small captions. 
2) I explained to the staff that we had a toddler with us so this is definitely unacceptable. Yet she said there is nothing she can do about it and in order to turn on the AC for 24 hours we need to top up $6 per pax per night, which means $42 for our room per night!
3) I called booking.com for help and after 1 hour the staff said that her management agreed for us to turn on AC for 24 hours with the additional top up of $6 per room per night. Since it is so hard for us to find a family room last min we had no option but to accept this. But I believe by right we should not have had to pay for this additional cost
4) Male toilet room are unclean
5) Facilities have run down so much since my first stay a few years ago. Even room fan also not working properly. Mattresses are so so old with so many stains and you even have to put on the bed linen and pillow cover by yourself - which is surprisingly a difficult task given the linens are especially tiny compared to the mattress size.
Overall it is supposed to be a value for money hostel but after looking at the additional AC top up and the bad conditions of this hotel I have to say you are paying more than what you eventually get. May as well consider a higher price for a newer hostel.","Location is great, 2-3 mins to 2 downtown line MRT stations

Not a problem for me since I was out sightseeing, but something to consider. I think this is common for hostels in Singapore though. 
The breakfast is very basic but I expected as much. The issue is that there is not enough physical space to accommodate everyone at peak times. I can't see any solution to this and it was only a minor inconvenience, but something to be aware of. 
There seems to be two types of people that stay in the hostel: typical backpackers and families or others there for non-tourist reasons. Strangely, it was the latter group that caused issues during my stay as they were incredibly noisy late at night, often screaming down the halls. There are signs to respect quiet hours but these guests ignored them. I don't know if this is a common occurrence of if I just had bad luck during my stay. Perhaps the latter since I was there for lunar new year and my last night was much quieter. 
I wanted to head to the airport at 12:30 so asked if I could check out a half hour late and was told I could not. It wasn't a huge inconvenience for me, but I also don't see why a half hour really mattered to the staff.","The power outlet, small shelf and individual light for each bed was very helpful. 
I had read someone say something about no hot water, but I always had it for my showers and I never had a problem finding an available shower stall during my stay. 
Besides noise from guests in the halls, the hostel was generally quiet and peaceful and the walls seemed to do a good job blocking noise from adjoining rooms. Also, the TV is in the lobby on the ground floor so no worries about having to hear that or anyone who might be socializing down there. 
The location is very convenient in that it is close to two Downtown Line MRT stations and not too far to walk to the Little India station, which is adjacent to the excellent Tekka Hawker center for inexpensive and delicious food options. If you don't mind a bit of walking you can even walk to the popular downtown/bay areas. Also, while the hostel is in Little India, it is in a very clean and fairly quiet part of it.",Stayed in February 2018,7.5,6.9,6.8,8.4,7,8.2,7.6,8.2

First of all, they say that there is WiFi. This is not true. Stayed here for several days and WiFi worked maybe one time out of ten. And when it worked it was extremely slow. Why promise WiFi when it’s not true? Second, the people working here leave the hostel at 11 pm, so not 24 h reception. One time I told them before they went home for the day that there was no toiletpaper in any of the two toilets that more than 50 (yes 50) people share together (disgusting toilets too), and THEY DID NOT refill the toilet paper until the next day, almost 12 hours later. Imagine how the toilets smelled and what they looked like.. Thirdly, it smelled as if there was a dead animal in the dorm that we were sleeping in, AND the rooms are extremely small so you basically sleep just right next to the person in the other bed (you can just reach out and touch a random person - or a random person can touch you). Fourth, the laundry is crazy expensive. Fifth, when I arrive they didn’t even show me were the washroom was, nor did I get a lower bed (I have a knee injury) even though saying to the staff that it’s extremely painful for me to climb up to the upper bed. Sixth, there are sooo many people staying in a very very small area, they are just trying to fit in as many beds as possible on a very small area and with as little of staff as possible.

4. There are 2 toilet and bath shared by 6 people in the room that needs improvement. Theres no bidet and its so small, you can barely move while youre in there.
5. Breakfast is also disappointing, they only offer bread, coffee and tea. They have 4 kinds of sandwich spread which i didnt try, i just had my bread toasted and coffee that day.

Pay more and find someplace else.”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Solo traveller', '• Bed in 14-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room', '• Stayed 4 nights']","Everything else is quite disappointing and quite disgusting - nothing like the pictures shown. I stayed there for 4 nights and it was a mistake. 
I stayed in the Attic storey, which was on the 3rd floor. The room is divided into two, so each half shares a bathroom. My half consisted of 6 beds, two fans, and a half-decent air conditioner.
Here are a few major things to complain about: 
SPACE - Not much place for you to put your things in such a small space; just a small shelf and a couple hooks if they aren't broken. I ended up hanging my wet towel and sweaty clothes on my bed frame and posts. I highly recommend renting a locker to be safe from pests and theft.
PESTS - On the last night, I found that there is a pretty serious rat infestation. My backpack was gnawed through by rats. I found out that they were actually attacking my bag and made a gaping hole, I threw the snacks into the waste bin, which they then later started attacking. At least five or more fought over the food all night long. I brought it up to the front desk (who I'm guessing is the owner/manager) when I checked out in the morning that there was a pest problem. He just smiled at me and said nothing because there were other people who came in to check in. I uploaded a photo of my eaten bag. 
CLEANLINESS - Given that there is a major rat problem here, you should be careful everywhere. Don't walk barefeet. Fortunately, the sheets, pillows, and blanket looked and smelled clean. The bathroom was ""cleaned"" every two days. There were used bottles on the floor the whole time I stayed there. Not much space to put your belongings to avoid getting soaked. There is a huge musty smell throughout the place from the lack of ventilation. 
SIMCARD - The hostel says they would provide a simcard to use during your stay. They didn't receive any new simcards and the existing ones were expired.","Location is pretty central, so it's convenient for travel.

Secondly, the lobby, lift and corridor had a bad smell for some reason. 
Thirdly, the level was like a maze. We had to make turns numerous times to reach our room. 
Forthly, my gf and i were really disappointed when we entered our room because it looked run-down and old.
Room and bed sheets were unclean. Bed sheets had dirty and black spots. Towels had stains. Room was super cramped. Shower head was loose like it was gonna break anytime and they didnt bother to fix it. Dirty bathroom. 
There were 2 of us but they provided us with 1 cup only. kettle was dusty and rusty.... 
We paid SGD494 for 2 nights and it didnt worth our money. We understand that we booked the hotel during peak period so it was more expensive but the main point is, we paid so much but it was such a waste of our money...... it was an uncomfortable experience. 
Customer service was alright. 
Overall, arianna hotel is the worst hotel we’ve ever stayed. Even Hotel 81, a budget hotel is so much better.  Unfortunately, we forgot to take pics of the room.

I coordinated with my card issuer, until now there is no funds being credited to my account. 
I know, probably this was not a human error but I suggest that there should be a consideration given since we had a proof that the hotel charged us already for the five-day stay. They should have returned the cash payment instead of the card payment.

Dirty wall and floor. The first room I got (420, watch out!) was so moldy, I had to sleep with an open door because of the smell. Tried to ask the receptionist to give me another room, because it’s not just simply unpleasant but dangerous healthwise, he said he can only sort it out on the following day. The wall was actually so wet for no particular reason, you could see water drops. The night after I got moved to another room, which still didn’t look great, but at least it had a window, was relatively spacious compared to the previous one, however I woke up in the middle of the night because of some noise caused by a 3 inches big cockroach having fun around. The receptionists didn’t seem to be too helpful, mostly didn’t even bother to let me finish my sentence, and once when I asked for advise in connection with transport I felt if I would have asked for a favour. Not to mention that I got recommended to get a taxi for $25, however Uber cost $15, if he would have had the patience to explain public transport, could cost possibly like $5. I know it’s a good price for accommodation in an expensive city, but I think hygiene and kindness are not supposed to be luxury.",,Stayed in March 2018,5.3,5,4.7,7.2,4.7,5.4,5.1,7

We had to pay AGAIN . The hotel promised to make a refund on October 24, 2017 with a bank prove .Yet, we still havent received any , even after the frequent negotiations with the hotel through booking.com 
Second ,  pictures tell our story . Viewers can enjoy the photos attached first . We originally booked a double room at this hotel for 4D3N . As late check-in, we were upgraded and assigned to stay the first night in a triple room  ,basic and a bit old, still which was so nice of their act.
However, we had never thought of any nightmare coming up . The next day we were arranged to this double room.  We even found TWO baby COCKROACHES hanging around on the tea-table. We regretted not to take the bodies of them ...
The secured lock of the room door was broken . The knob of the bathroom couldnt function well .  
We immediately called for changing another room , the room service just told us that they run a budget hotel thats why we ended up like that . They refused to change a new room for us NOR made any compensation just because the manager was off the duty . (The staff said) 
We realized this hotel is a 2 star one or may be a budget one when we had made a reservation. HOWEVER, we have NEVER experienced such trashy stay in Singapore, marked an obvious stink in our trip . 
Besides, we met and talked to 3 staff at the hotel and none of them was patient . Their gesture and tone of speaking were very impatient  and instructive. 
Dont stay in this so-callled 2 star hotel anymore. Every thing is shabbier than a local inn or a motel.

I have been in cleaner, quieter, friendlier and frankly much better hostels! The room we had didn’t have a window, that’s ok we are in a cheap hotel in a city. However the room stank when we first walked in and I mean damp mildewy smokey stink! The shower room was even worse! It was asthough they had employed a blind cleaner who was allergic to cleaning (no offense meant to blind cleaners and people allergic to cleaning). There we hairs all over the shower room floor and I mean obvious, not the casual missed one in the corner, no, there would be less hair on the floor in a salon! There was what looked like nasal excrement smeared up the walls and basically grime in all conceivable places. In fact even places you wouldn’t think there could be grime. The bed was like a bench (now for me personally I like a firm matress, however Donald Trump would have more give on immigration than these stone beauties!) The sheets were that of an incontenant hospital department where if you got in too quick you’d slide across and be off the otherside quicker than a waterpark death slide. The so called fun started when Singatel clearly had a bargain basement deal on for those with Indian mobile numbers, the only issue for us was that the offer only existed in our corridor! The chap was obviously having signal issues though because his receiver obvious couldn’t hear him unless he shouted (either that or he had never been taught about an indoor voice or even the courtesy of having the conversion in your own room). Not that, that would have helped as even the room opposites’ TV echoed beautifully through the corridor and into our room. Now as we are true to our endearing British nature we started with the passive aggressive approach of politely asking whether he knew what the time was and explained we were hoping to be able to sleep.","Checking out!

get one of these rooms! The lack of sunlight meant we would get woken up

Absolutely horrible. We stayed for 5 nights and I would recommend nobody
stay for more than 1-2 nights because the lack of natural light just
made us feel awful and pretty much ruined the last part of our holiday.
There was a strange lack of furniture, so no bedside tables to put things on, only 1 power point near the tv, and the desk the kettle was on was tiny. No fridge to keep milk in so kind of pointless having a kettle. Nearby is no supermarket so it's quite a hike towards the cbd to find a loaf of bread etc. 
You can get cheaper hotel rooms (reasonably cheaper than one here without any windows and much cheaper than one here with windows) a bit further out of the city (but near a train station) such as in Geylang that have a fridge and windows and supermarkets nearby etc. I highly recommend staying somewhere else such as Bright Star.","There was a hawker stall right on the corner called Economical Curry

In our room right above my pillow there was a hole in the sealing with all pipes clearly visible. The walls looked like renovation was badly needed. Air con was too cold (it was not possible to set different temperature) to keep it all night long, so we would switch it off before going to sleep. And then the night was too hot. The room was super tiny. Just for beds and that's it. Not even a table and chair. Maybe it is my fault, that I have booked one of the cheapest rooms in Singapore straight away without checking other options. My recommendation is that if you travel with family, pay 20 - 30 eur per night more and get a room in a 3* hotel. I think experience will be much different. This place could be ok if you need just a place to sleep.","The beds even though made sounds every time you turn, were quite comfy. Generally the place was quite clean.

Check-in:
We arrived around 3pm i.e. the stated check-in time, but was told that we had to wait for the receptionist to check with housekeeping if the room was ready. Turns out, it wasn't! We had to wait for another 30~45 minutes or so before we were allowed into our rooms. Didn't help their case when the only keycard we were issued did not work, so we had to go back to the Reception to have it changed. We were given a later check-out the next day, so 1pm instead of 12pm to make up for this! 
Room: 
While the room/toilets were on the smaller side and didn't bother us much, I think the rooms could really have been improved by having a fridge! One of our concerns was the lack of a lock to the shared balcony (i.e. someone from another room technically had access to your room - vice versa) even when you had a keypad to your own room. It didn't help that there was no security box within the room either. 
Noise: 
As you've probably read in the other reviews, noise is a factor. We didn't find the pub downstairs too particularly noisy throughout the night, but that's probably because our room was further away (you could still feel the bass tho!). But it was the housekeeping that was roaming the corridors in the wee hours of the morning that really disturbed our sleep! You could hear the constant opening and closing of doors starting around 8am. Probably didn't help the case on noise as there was a photoshoot on-going so there was a camera crew making quite a racket outside our room.","The hotel is very Instagram worthy, with quirky furniture and nice decor in both the reception and rooms.

”","['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Balcony Room', '• Stayed 9 nights']","— Hellish noise levels!
Don't stay in this hotel if you're a light sleeper or plan to sleep before 3 am. Just 10 meters next to the hotel is a Bollywood-style disco with music blasting into the street all night. We first stayed in the lovely 3rd-floor balcony room. The noise was unbearable without earplugs (which we had to buy later on), absolutely crazy. In the first night, I went to the receptionist to ask if the disco owners can turn down the volume. Despite numerous complaints of hotel guests, the noise continued as the disco owners refused to comply. The manager offered us the quietest room in the hotel (The Courtyard room) but only for two nights. To cure the jetlag, we accepted. This ground floor room was quieter and spacious (but no outside courtyard, as the door was kept locked), all rather dark, sterile and lacked privacy as people would pass by the windows with a direct view into the bathroom (!) — we kept the curtains closed all times. Equipped with earplugs we moved back to the balcony room, which we preferred in the end, despite the smaller size.
— Both rooms had no wardrobe to stow away clothes? A few wall hooks, yes, but it was utterly impractical, unusual and rather annoying after a few days.
— The cleanliness and room service didn't convince, it was all sloppily done:  they forgot to refill tea/coffee, didn't replace towels, lots of old dust and debris in the corners. A shame as it doesn't match the design standard of the place.
— The breakfast was disappointing. We had hoped for something local, lighter and fresher, but the option offered was floppy toast, greasy butter and jam with inedible coffee. Basically, all foods that aren't nice at 30 degrees Celsius/ 80% humidity. The sparse selection would have been fine if the food quality was better. A rather sad and uninspiring display, and although we already paid for breakfast, we went elsewhere instead.","— Polite and friendly hotel staff and manager
— Questions were met with concrete suggestions (less so solution, see negatives below)
— The hotel's design is quirky, cosy and nestles itself nicely into the buzzing atmosphere of Little India
— The entire place was designed with much attention to detail, colour and materials — all in all, we liked the style
— The pool is small but big enough for a quick swim to cool down and refresh
— We loved the views across the roofs by the poolside from the sun loungers, the pool area was kept very clean
— Well located in a lively and authentic area with some great food places and hawker centres nearby
— Less than 3 min. to Rochor MRT station
— The place has potential and we'd love to come back if the points below would be addressed with care. 
— As of now, I wouldn't recommend staying longer than 1-2 nights max. for a quick layover.
— Despite the sloppy room service (see below) the beds were always freshly done and the mattresses felt new and very good.
— If the noise wouldn't be so terrible in that street, this could be (in theory) a nice hotel for relaxing sleep.",Stayed in April 2019,7.2,7.3,6.9,7.8,6.8,7.9,6.5,7.7

The mugs in the room were filthy. I had to clean the sink and desk myself because they were covered in spillages and bits of food. One day I left a soaking wet towel on the floor of the bathroom for it to be replaced but it was just left there - I'm quite convinced that the cleaners didn't even look in the bathroom that day as the toilet roll wasn't replaced either. 
Breakfast is a whole different topic... I stayed here for 6 days and for at least 3 of the breakfasts there was no where to sit from the used plates and cups that other residents had left behind and hadn't been cleared up. Multiple times I'd go down and there would be no cereal/bread left and it was hard to find any staff to ask for replacements too. I also discovered on day 4 that there were hot food options - not one member of staff had told me this, I was told by a fellow resident.
There were also moth cocoons growing in the room when I arrived, I removed some of them but they kept appearing - this is a problem that housekeeping are also aware of but doing nothing about.
Further to these things, the hotel got taken over by professional photoshoots twice on my visit. With no prior warning, both made it awkward to get around but one in particular blocked the hallway and entrance to my bedroom door, I had to climb over and move equipment to access it. The hotel is small and it would be considerate to at least let people know that there would be disruption.","The decor is beautifully designed.

Breakfast could've been better. Our breakfast meal consists of eggs (scrambled or sunny) and bread (White or Wheat + strawberry jam or butter) White milk and corn flakes, thats pretty much it. Also expected room service to be better. My room wasn't made for two days, when i called to ask why? they finally sent someone to make our rooms in the afternoon. It comes down to the price you pay. For the same amount you could opt for a similar hotel, with more amenities and a better breakfast with better room service. But if you think filling your Instagram with a bunch of Wes Anderson inspired photos is more important, then by all means this is the place for you. Alternatively i would suggest coming for a meal at 'The Great Mischief' ( their in house restaurant) instead of spending your nights here, Just my two cents.","The overall concept of the hotel is admirable. Many would say that the place has a very Wes Anderson feel. It does and the interior and decor is brilliantly done. There are many photographable spots for you to fill your Instagram with.

Noisy surroundings!”,"['• Leisure trip', '• Couple', '• The Deluxe Room', '• Stayed 3 nights']","There are many areas for improvement for this new hotel - or at least we were unlucky to experience a number of unpleasant things. 
We arrived to the hotel bit after 10pm due to a delayed flight. The check-in went smooth, and even though the room seemed too small (the booking said it's a 15m2 room, but it felt max 10m2), the only thing I wanted was to go to bed and get some rest. However that turned out to be impossible because of extremely loud music from a bar outside, reaching 80dB at times (when 40dB is desired for sleep). We asked to switch the rooms, and that was only possible from the next day. The music was playing until at least 2:30am, and the next day we were woken up by the sound of construction work. :))
Anyways, we switched the rooms, and in the beginning I was happy that we got 'upgraded' to a bigger room. Until I realized that we were actually supposed to get this size room, since I booked a 'Deluxe' room. I felt cheated in a way... the price difference for three nights between the rooms was around S$100. Well, at least in the end we ended up in the 'right' room and could get some sleep as well.
Other things that could be improved: water pressure in the shower; seems like there's no room service/cleaning, or at least for a short stay; if you leave your luggage to be stored after check-out, they put your bags in a 'common' corridor that can be used by other guests to go out, which doesn't feel so secure.","As many people have noted, it is a beautiful, instagram-perfect hotel! Unfortunately, I think that the looks oversells the actual experience at the hotel.. Anyhow, other nice things were helpful staff, very clean rooms, great quality of towels and robes. The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to different MRT stations, including downtown line, north east line, and north south line.

Checking in and even checking out is not easy because staff members are basically never present and you have to hunt around for them to track them down. This is not acceptable for an establishment that deals with customers. For me, checking in was a nightmare and I had to wait around on the street for a good 30 minutes before being able to get inside. You cannot check in after midnight apparently, although this information is not adequately shared upon booking.
Breakfast is also a lie. I stayed here two nights and there was no ""free breakfast"" on either day. That's because to get breakfast, you have to 'talk to a member of staff', and there are no staff members to talk to. I believe that the hostel does this on purpose to avoid having to give any breakfast to guests - but it is wrong. Either this staffing issue needs to be sorted out, or the information should be removed from Booking.com's listing. Other guests were waiting around for breakfast and asking me where it was. Just go down to Bencoolen street and get yourself some kaya toast for a few dollars. Less hassle.","It's a hostel. Just a hostel. A basic hostel. There is a bed and a bathroom. That is it. The bed is comfortable enough and the room is kept at a comfortable temperature.

2. In the new room, which was a ""family"" room with 4 bunk beds, cockroaches and bed bugs felt like home. When we approached the staff with the problem, they seemed to be fully aware of the situation already and just sprayed around some disgusting insect-spray. The smell in this hostel was terrible in any room, anyways. After this incident, two of us moved in a new hostel, which was way better for the same money.
3. In the new double-bed room on the second night the bathroom was full of insects and we even had the pleasure to spend the night with a mouse under our bed. We saw it already in the evening and told the staff, which said they had no mouses at all. After asking about the rat or mouse trap, which was in the hallway just next to the ""lobby"" (!), they said they will send someone. Also, they offered that we could put bleach on our bags by ourselves to keep the mouse out of it, which we did not do of course. No one ever came, and we had to spend the worst night of our trip in this room.","Nothing good about this sinkhole. Wondering, that this place is still allowed to stay in business. We were just sorry about the staff, which seemed to be treated very badly and had to work long shifts on several days without any sleep.",Stayed in April 2019,5.7,4.7,5,7.3,4.8,6.8,5.4,

Seems like an underground hostel where local or temporary workers stay for a long time and that is probably why they dont bother keeping it to a minimum standard.

I saw 3 different type of bugs during my 1 nigth stay( 2 cocrroach and 1 flea/bed bug type). 
I traveled many hostels in thailand for way cheaper but i guess it s a different story in singapore or just for this one.
