Otherwise, ok.”","['• Leisure trip', '• Solo traveller', '• Upper Bed in 18-Bed Mixed Dormitory Room', '• Stayed 2 nights']","The way that this hostel is run and staffed is ridiculous. Checking in and even checking out is not easy because staff members are basically never present and you have to hunt around for them to track them down. This is not acceptable for an establishment that deals with customers. For me, checking in was a nightmare and I had to wait around on the street for a good 30 minutes before being able to get inside. You cannot check in after midnight apparently, although this information is not adequately shared upon booking.
Breakfast is also a lie. I stayed here two nights and there was no ""free breakfast"" on either day. That's because to get breakfast, you have to 'talk to a member of staff', and there are no staff members to talk to. I believe that the hostel does this on purpose to avoid having to give any breakfast to guests - but it is wrong. Either this staffing issue needs to be sorted out, or the information should be removed from Booking.com's listing. Other guests were waiting around for breakfast and asking me where it was. Just go down to Bencoolen street and get yourself some kaya toast for a few dollars. Less hassle.","It's a hostel. Just a hostel. A basic hostel. There is a bed and a bathroom. That is it. The bed is comfortable enough and the room is kept at a comfortable temperature. Also, each guest is supplied with a locker, though you need to pay a deposit of S$10 (or an alternative in another currency). The other good thing is the location.

For the first night we got placed on a completely different room than we booked, because ""booking.com messed up the reservation"" and just had one room instead of two rooms.
2. In the new room, which was a ""family"" room with 4 bunk beds, cockroaches and bed bugs felt like home. When we approached the staff with the problem, they seemed to be fully aware of the situation already and just sprayed around some disgusting insect-spray. The smell in this hostel was terrible in any room, anyways. After this incident, two of us moved in a new hostel, which was way better for the same money.
3. In the new double-bed room on the second night the bathroom was full of insects and we even had the pleasure to spend the night with a mouse under our bed. We saw it already in the evening and told the staff, which said they had no mouses at all. After asking about the rat or mouse trap, which was in the hallway just next to the ""lobby"" (!), they said they will send someone. Also, they offered that we could put bleach on our bags by ourselves to keep the mouse out of it, which we did not do of course.
