Good through 2009 at least.                                        </td><td>Reserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>Mendoza Province                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>LujÃ¡n de Cuyo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>Michael Schachner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td><td>@wineschach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>Chakana 2006 Reserve Malbec (LujÃ¡n de Cuyo)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td><td>Malbec                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>Chakana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td></tr>\n",

It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.                                         & Reserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & 25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Mendoza Province                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & LujÃ¡n de Cuyo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               & Michael Schachner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                & @wineschach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      & Chakana 2006 Reserve Malbec (LujÃ¡n de Cuyo)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & Malbec                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & Chakana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \\\\\n",

It's a serious but inviting red with spongey, ripe berry aromas topped by pure raspberry, cherry and cola flavors. It's both racy and composed, with a pile of bitter chocolate on the long finish. Good through 2009 at least.                                         | Reserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 91                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Mendoza Province                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | LujÃ¡n de Cuyo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Michael Schachner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | @wineschach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Chakana 2006 Reserve Malbec (LujÃ¡n de Cuyo)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Malbec                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Chakana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n",

On the palate, this is tight as a drum initially, but more expansive as it unfolds. Cherry, plum, raspberry, vanilla and woodspice flavors finish pure, clean and easy. This is a fine yet manageable Rioja that's not trying too hard. Drink through 2016. | Crianza                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Northern Spain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Rioja                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Michael Schachner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | @wineschach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ViÃ±edos Real Rubio 2010 Crianza  (Rioja)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Tempranillo Blend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | ViÃ±edos Real Rubio                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n",

This is a wine to age for a couple of years, so drink from 2017.                                                                                                                                                | Kritt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 90                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 30                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Alsace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Alsace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Roger Voss                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | @vossroger                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Domaine Gresser 2013 Kritt Gewurztraminer (Alsace)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | GewÃ¼rztraminer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Domaine Gresser                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n",

       "1 This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.                      \n",
       "2 Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.                                                  \n",
       "3 Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.\n",
