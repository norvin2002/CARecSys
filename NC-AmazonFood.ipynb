Good enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "3 I'm disappointed with the flavor. The chocolate notes are especially weak. Milk thickens it but the flavor still disappoints. This was worth a try but I'll never buy again. I will use what's left, which will be gone in no time thanks to the small cans.                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4 These stars are small, so you can give 10-15 of those in one training session.  I tried to train our dog with \"\"Ceaser dog treats\"\",  it just made our puppy hyper.  If you compare the ingredients, you will know why.  Little stars has just basic food ingredients without any preservatives and food coloring.  Sweet potato flavor also did not make my hand smell like dog food.\n",
       "5 These are the BEST treats for training and rewarding your dog for being good while grooming.  Lower in calories and loved by all the doggies.  Sweet potatoes seem to be their favorite Wet Noses treat!                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "3 This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' \"\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\"\" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch."

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.</span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td></tr>\n",

My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.

It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          </td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td></tr>\n",

I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td></tr>\n",

I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td></tr>\n",

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice & These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest. & 37 & 4.351351\\\\\n",

My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 37 & 4.351351\\\\\n",

My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 37 & 4.351351\\\\\n",

One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 37 & 4.351351\\\\\n",

We're not in 1962 any more, Toto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 37 & 4.351351\\\\\n",

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice | These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest. | 37 | 4.351351 |\n",

My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 37 | 4.351351 |\n",

It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 37 | 4.351351 |\n",

My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 37 | 4.351351 |\n",

One star for this printed edition of the book.&lt;br /&gt;My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 37 | 4.351351 |\n",

       "1 These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.\n",
       "2 All of my children love this book.  My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4 One of my earliest memories is of this book.  My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "5 I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

We're not in 1962 any more, Toto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.</span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td><td>Read it once. Read it twice.

My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.

I was expecting a larger book, not the 4x5 inch book that was delivered.

My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td><td>Read it once.

I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </span></td><td>37</td><td>4.351351</td><td>Read it once.

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice & These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest. & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

I was expecting a larger book, not the 4x5 inch book that was delivered.  It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

       "\t 0006641040 & 150497 & A1HKYQOFC8ZZCH & Maria Apolloni \"\"lanarossa\"\"                    &  2 &  2 & 1 & 1334707200 & The story is great, the softcover book is disappointing     & I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

We're not in 1962 any more, Toto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & 37 & 4.351351 & Read it once.

Reading Chicken Soup With Rice | These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest. | 37 | 4.351351 | Read it once.

My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 37 | 4.351351 | Read it once.

It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 37 | 4.351351 | Read it once.

       "| 0006641040 | 150496 | A3KKR87BJ0C595 | Gretchen Goodfellow \"\"Lover of children's lit\"\" |  3 |  3 | 5 | 1111363200 | You'll use it once, you'll use it twice                     | One of my earliest memories is of this book.  My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 37 | 4.351351 | Read it once.

One star for this printed edition of the book.&lt;br /&gt;My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 37 | 4.351351 | Read it once.

       "1 These days, when a person says, \"\"chicken soup\"\" they're probably going to follow up those words with, \"\"for the soul\"\" or maybe \"\"for the teenaged soul\"\".  Didn't used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"\"chicken soup\"\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"\"with rice!\"\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak's catchy 1962 children's book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn't dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak's other great rhyming tale \"\"Pierre\"\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It's a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there's robin's nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"\"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\"\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child's reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you're just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven't found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"\"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\"\" with the correct oomph, you're missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"\"Chicken Soup With Rice\"\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"\"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\"\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It's Sendak at his finest.\n",
       "2 All of my children love this book.  My first grader got it for Christmas and loves to read the rhymes.  She is proud that she can do it herself.  (Each month her teacher works on a month from the book with the class-not that she reads independently yet.)  My girls especially enjoy reading the month they were born and singing \"\"going once, going twice, going chicken soup with rice\"\".  This book is a classic that I remember from my childhood.  I highly recommend it.  I just wish the book was a larger size.  It tends to get lost in the bookshelf among regular sized books.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

It looked like something that was created off of a copy machine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4 One of my earliest memories is of this book.  My mother, who read to us constantly, read this one to us, and we quoted it non-stop.  In fact, that was a typical sort of soup we would beg for at the grocery because of this book!<br /><br />Since then, I have used the book in every class/teaching situation I have been in.  I have never met a child who did not LOVE it, and ask to be read it again and again.  It sure beats all those stupid songs you sing in preschool about the months of the year! :)  Even if you are not a Maurice Sendak fan, you will enjoy this one, because it is so original and poetic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "5 I give five stars to the Maurice Sendak story. One star for this printed edition of the book.<br />My children had an older copy this book, so I was very familiar with the previous softcover version. I ordered this for my granddaughters, but I'm embarrassed to give it as a gift, it looks so puny. The book is about the size of a postcard and I think it's overpriced. I've learned my lesson: I will not be buying any more softcover children books, next time I'll get a used copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

We're not in 1962 any more, Toto.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
